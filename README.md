# Tauri by Simon Labs

## How to use the labs

All lab tracks have their own branch. Each track is divided into parts. Each part is divided into steps.

Each step from the lab is a tagged commit in the format `branch_part_step`, e.g. `chatgpt_1_1` would be the ChatGPT track at the `1. Application` part at its first step. Then if you want to go forward to the next step you simply checkout `chatgpt_1_2`.

```bash
# Clone the repo into "labs"
git clone https://github.com/simonhyll/tauri-by-simon-labs labs
# Enter the labs folder
cd labs
# Checkout a lab
git checkout chatgpt_1_0
```
